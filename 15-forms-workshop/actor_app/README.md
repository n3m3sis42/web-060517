1. Make a form with a search box (get '/actors')
- when user searches in the box, it should print out all the actors' names that matched
- when user doesn't search, renders all actors

2. build out a resource for characters
 new, create, update, show, index

3. character
 use form_for  
  actor_name
  on edit - show the actor name
  on create/update, should update the actor name (don't use any nested form helpers -- i.e. accepts_nested_attributes_for)
